## Story Arcs

Story Arcs are constructed as follows:

1. Goal
2. Opportunity
3. Strategy
4. Plan
5. Sequences

#### Example

**Goal**: Lucenia wants to escape her horrible life

**Opportunity**: She could escape to her cousin's house far to the north.

**Strategy**: Save enough money to sneak away with the yearly merchant carivan that travels through town most of the way to the north.

**Plan**

* Buy less each week and hide the money
    * Hide it from her older brother
    * Hide it from the town constable who makes her pay her mother's fines
* Choice...
    * Sneak onto the carivan
    * Make friends with someone in the carivan who will hide her
    * Openly ask to join the caravan
* Survive the 8 week trip with the caravan
* Avoid being seen in the local towns
* Find her cousin
* Survive the trip from the far north city to the house in the woods


The plan adds **Interactions** to objects related to the arc. So, for example, when Lucenia interacts with the caravan when it arrives, she has a choice to sneak onto the carivan, to make friends with someone, or openly ask to join the caravan. Each of those actions has consequences (making it an interaction, not just an action).


#### Goal

Start with the high-level motivation. The thing the character would want wish for if they had a magic wand and 5 seconds to decide what to wish for. This is a constant. Fiction. This is a **character goal**. Raiment is character-driven so these goals should be attatched a specific character as the primary driver, even if it is a shared goal.

The goal's should be high-level and "simple." Often they are about love, power, money, escape or some of fundamental need. It should take one sentence to describe them. The details will evolve in the story itself.

The goal does not change: it either succeeds or fails.

#### Opportunity

What's the big opportunity the character sees to fulfill this goal? This is not _how_ they will fulfill the goal but **what** the opportunity is. If they need wealth, what will be the source of wealth? Make this a tangible person, place, or event that makes the player motivation non-abstract.

This also does not change until the goal is resolved in either success or failure.

### Strategy

This is the 1-3 lines describing **how** the opportunity will be taken advantage of. This should be high-level enough that it does not change.

### Plan

This is where we get into the details.

Think of the plan as a set of events, actions, interactions that the character sees as needing to happen to implement that strategy. This includes forks in the road, "If X happens, then Y and Z...but if it fails, I'll need to be ready to do A, B, and C." This is a loose set of what _might_ happen. Each of the plan is referred to as a **sequence** (you'll see in a moment why it's called a sequence, not a step).

Depending on the length of the story, it's probably good to have a half dozen to a couple dozen sequences loosely prepared.

### Sequences

This is where the gameplay happens. These are not planned in advance. Now, funamental to Raiment and telling the story is _things don't go according to plan_. If they did, it would be boring.

So as the character approaches the next step in their plan, you need to introduce **Conflict**. Conflict is composed of two parts: a **Problem** and a **Complication**. The Problem is what makes fulfilling the next step plan take some work. The Complication is what makes solving the problem not straightforward, often making it hard or better introducing a _trade-off_.

To determine how a character approaches a conflict, the general pattern is this:

-   The character _needs_ to fulfil the next step of the plan
-   Their encounter the problem: their primary value in determines how they would most simply solve this problem
-   The complication then should make that first approach impossible
-   Again, looking to their primary value, how do they now solve it?
-   What could go wrong? Does it?

Following patterns of narrative storytelling, each sequence should be composed roughly of the character:

1. They take an action to fuifill the plan
2. The action does not resolve the situation; instead the urgency, complexity, importance, and stakes only increase.
3. The circumstances force them to revisit their approach; they take another action trying to fulfill the plan
4. The action does not resolve the situation; instead the urgency, complexity, importance, and stakes increase even further
5. The circumstances force them to revisit their approach; they act again trying to fulfill the plan
6. Perhaps they fail, this time with finality. As a result, their character and the circumstances are changed permanent. The character is no longer the same (they may be stronger or weaker because of it: but they are not the same). The goal is no longer relevant: it has been seen through to the end.
7. Or they succeed. The goal is acheived (though maybe not exactly as they anticipated). As a result, their character is changed permanently (the trade-off: an unexpected strengthing or weaking, but they are not the same). The goal is no longer relevant as it been seen through to the end.

⚠️ TODO: "failure" is not the right terminology here. The "lack of resolution" at any scene can be exciting and adding complication in a good way. This draft text equates intricate plot-lines sound like they're always the characters failing at what they attempt.

In the context of the game, each attempt should have a known chance of succeeding. Based on what the character is attempting, intutitively is should be decided if resolution from the attempt is "likely", "unlikely". Simple plot points that do not need to explored deeply should be "likely" to succeed: most often being resolved in a single scene, sometimes two. For sequences you want to dig into, it should be considered "complex".

| type    | 1st  | 2nd  | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| simple  | 100% | 30%  | 3%  | 1%  | 1%  | 1%  |
| normal  | 100% | 90%  | 75% | 30% | 5%  | 1%  |
| complex | 100% | 100% | 90% | 60% | 20% | 5%  |

# Appendix

### Reference notes

-   The Story Arc progression borrows from a product development checklist: (1) What is the large, "fairly obvious" business goal (e.g. a revenue target)? (2) What is the market where that business goal can be met (e.g. market segment + persoans)? (3) What's the brief strategy explaining, without details, how that business goal can be met in that market? (4) If it all makes sense so far, what are the specific pain-points in that market and accompanying user stories, if solved, will implement that strategy? (5) Now iterate on this user stories by creating projects, building features, and getting feedback. Resolve or discard the stories based on external feedback, but don't lose sight of the overall business goal.
