A voxel-based, procedural adventure world.  

Imagine the screen-to-screen game play of the original King's Quest I, but instead of 2D screens, there are small 3D voxel scenes the player moves between.

Instead of a hard-coded story, the story is generated in a semi-procedural manner, adding to variations to each playthrough.  Some of these variations may be cosmetic and simply interesting: others may be fundamentally different plot challenges creating emergent behavior in each play through.
