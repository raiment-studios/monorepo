A computer-aided, "pen & paper" procedural, solo storytelling RPG.  

## Getting started

Demo: [https://storytelling.raiment.studio/](https://storytelling.raiment.studio/)

## Vision

A more direct interpretation of the core Kestrel rulebook.

This should run off the same content base as other games. It's a way to test and validate the procedural _story_ is possible and enjoyable, without becoming distracted by "just building an engine" where the story is lost.
