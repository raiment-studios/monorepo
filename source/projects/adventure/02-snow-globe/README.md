# Snow Globe

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/feedback-welcome!-1a6)](https://github.com/raiment-studios/monorepo/discussions)

A single region voxel game where the adventure plays out in a limited space that is constantly changing. Focus is on storytelling and game mechanics (versus infinite world exploration!).

## Getting started

## Vision

A short, but fully finished game set in the world of Kestrel. Confined to a 256x256 voxel location, as the game progresses, that [location modifies itself](https://twitter.com/RidleyWinters/status/1528219337659600896). The sequence of events is fairly linear.
