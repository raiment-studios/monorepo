# Snow Globe

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/feedback-welcome!-1a6)](https://github.com/raiment-studios/monorepo/discussions)

A single region voxel game where the adventure plays out in a limited space that is constantly changing. Focus is on storytelling and game mechanics (versus infinite world exploration!).

## Getting started

## Vision

A short, but fully finished game set in the world of Kestrel. Confined to a 256x256 voxel location, as the game progresses, that [location modifies itself](https://twitter.com/RidleyWinters/status/1528219337659600896). The sequence of events is fairly linear.

_Target Future Announcement_

> Snow Globe is a new, fun to play adventure game released by [Raiment Studios](https://raiment-studios.github.io/). You play the part of Kestrel, an android awoken in the mysterious world of Galthea where she seeks to find Tristan, her creator.  As Kestrel, you explore the ever-changing world and interact with characters, discover artifacts from the world's veiled history, and complete the adventure in a beautiful, interactive world.
>
> The game mixes the classic feel of old school adventure games in a cleverly designed, voxel-based art style.  The story and the world dynamically evolve uniquely in each playthrough creating a novel experience every time. The world of Galthea presents the player with a peaceful, low-stress in which to fulfill Kestrel's quest.
> 
> `Kestrel: Snow Globe` is completely free and takes about 30 minutes to play end-to-end. Elements of procedural design give the game replay value to uncover different endings and different paths along with to explore the world of Galthea.
>
> This is Raiment Studios' first game release centered around the world of Kestrel. The game is open source, including the content and worldbuilding material.  Raiment Studios is encouraging reuse and contributions to their projects.
