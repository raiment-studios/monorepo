          As a fictional character, the character *always* looks at problems
          in terms of their primary_value. They then give weight to their 
          secondary_value as well in how they decide to act. Their actions 
          should always promote those values.

          Their trigger_value is a blind-spot in their character: a place where
          they have extreme, irrational reactions when they see others following
          this value and do not listen to the logic of others.

          In generating the backstory, answer the question *why* for each
          of these values.
