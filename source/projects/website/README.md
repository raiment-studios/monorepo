🐉 DANGER: this project uses some unconventional approaches! 🐉

This project builds and publishes to the raiment-studios.github.io site. Note that **the source is stored in the monorepo and raiment-studios.github.io is used pruely as a destination**.  Direct edits to the destination repo will potentially break the intended workflow (or at least are unexpected).
