# Mission, Vision, and Values

## Mission

_The "mission" of an organziation can have a lot of different definitions. Here we define it as a long-lasting statement of what work we do when we contribute to the project.  This complements the [Vision](./vision.md), which is which is a statement of what the world looks like a some distant point in the future if we continue to pursue this mission._


* Make the project easier to contribute to
* Ensure consistency in the content style
* Ensure openness & inclusiveness to the world content

## Vision

_The "vision" of an organization can have a lot of different defintions. Here we define it as optimistic look into the future where the organization has been extremely successful: what does that world look like? What has this organization created? This should be an inspiring and lasting statement that will speak to a variety of projects taken on within the organization over the years. This should complement and set context for the mission, design goals, and principles the organization follows._


### Vision

Create an imaginary universe akin to that of the Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pathfinder that is entirely open source and without restrictive license so anyone can use it as a basis for any work they want to do. Provide just enough guidelines to ensure self-consistency in the fictional content and provide plenty of freedom in how that content is used. 

Organize this open content into a unified, self-consistent, versioned "distribution" so the world feels consistent and compelling - not merely a collection of contributions.  As it is open source, others are welcome to fork the content and create their own distributions - not unlike the way Linux distributions work.  And of course, packs of additional content outside the main distribution can always be used.

Atop this content, provide a rulebook, similar to that of something like Dungeons and Dragons, that provides the general rules of how the games should behave in the world of Kestrel. The rules implemented like a series of "cards" that procedurally impact the next phase of the game. Provide several games that are set in this world and implement these rules.  To the driving spirit of it being an open univrese of content, each of these games should prioritize making it to incremental improve and contribute back to the core game. As these games are procedural in nature, they should support infinite replays especially with pluggable content.


### What it is not

**Cutting edge graphics**: the principle of being easy to contribute to advocates for a simplified, voxel-based style simply because complex models and animations generally are non-trivial to make as compared to voxel-based content. If the tooling changes that this is not longer the case, then this may change.
