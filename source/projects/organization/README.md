# Raiment Studios: the organization

These guidelines define _how people we work_ as the Raiment Studios community. 

The goals of the guidelines are to improve:

* The **consistency** of the work
* The **efficiency** of the work
* The **clarity** of the communication

The _effectiveness_ of these guidelines should be determined by how easy it is to get started productively participating in the community, how frictionless large changes are, and the ratio of productive work to overhead not directly related to the work itself.
