# Raiment Studios: the organization

The content of this folder helps define _how people we work_ as the group Raiment Studios.

The purpose of these guidelines are to improve the **consistency** of the work, the **efficiency** of the work, and the **clarity** of the communication.  The effectiveness of these guidelines should be determined by how easy it is to get started productively participating in the community, how frictionless large changes are, and the ratio of productive work to overhead not directly related to the work itself.
