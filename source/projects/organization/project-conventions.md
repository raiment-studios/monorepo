Every project should have a `Makefile` that defines the following commands that should "just work" when run in a valid development environment:

* `ensure` - install dependencies and other "one-time" setup
* `clean` - remove all generated files from the project
* `build` 
* `dev` - run in manner optimized for rapid development
* `run` - run with production settings
* `test`
* `benchmark`
* `publish`
