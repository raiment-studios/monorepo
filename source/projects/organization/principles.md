The company **Principles** are the general guidelines for how work is done as part of the company. 

By having written principles, these are intended to make behaviors more _objective_ and _consistent_.  It should always be okay to politely ask someone to adhere to the company principles to encourage this consistency and objectivity.

## People first

Individuals are and will always be more important than any particular project work, implementation detail, decision, innovation, mistake, disagreement, success, or anything else that comes up as part of this work.  That principle _must always be followed_.  If you do not agree with this principle, this project will be frustrated for you.

The primary goal of the company is to create an environment that is inspiring, safe, and encouraging. Contributions and learning should feel easy within this group.


**Upsides**

* Our focus is on the work, not ego or opinions irrelevant to the actual project

**Risks**

* Overly cautious behavior prevents direct, efficient discussions
* Policing of behaviors creates an exclusionist group of contributors


**⚠️TODO**

* [ ] Split out into a Values page?


## Show don't tell

Rapid prototying, mocks, and demonstration branches are preferred over long documents.  This principle is intended to balance [Consistent, Structured Processes](#consistent-structured-processes) so that process does not _reduce_ efficiency.

**Upsides**

**Risks**

**Examples**

* Protoypes and mini-demos
* Proposals including sketches
* Proposals including similar examples from other existing external work

**Pitfalls**

* "Take my word for it"

**Notes**

* This principle is part of the rationale for the [Wiki](/source/projects//wiki) is considered in-scope for the Raiment project. We want to ensure rapid prototyping that can utilize other assets within the project can be done in a straightforward manner.

## Consistent, structured processes

Any _non-trivial_ work should follow the same standard set of steps from introducing the proposal, implementing it, reviewing it, testing it, and releasing it. The purpose of this structure is that consistency allows more efficient, objective work to be done as less time is lost to confusion due to an ill-defined process. This is particularly important for distributed, community-driven, creative work.

Consistent processes should be thought of as "work patterns" (in the "design patterns" sense). 

**Examples**

* Templates & prototypes (in the "copy from an existing example" sense)
* Self review checkiists
* Peer review checklists

**Upsides**

* Low-overhead, efficienct communication

**Risks**

* More rocess overhead than "actual work"
* Constraints on flexibility or innovation
* Process before purpose

## Be obvious and explicit over clever

**Examples**

**Pitfalls**

* Clever or cute project, service, library names - describe what they do instead. Clever names, while fun, force new contributors to learn new terminology whereas more "boring" but obvious names immediately give them a hint as to purpose of a thing

## Gitops driven

Changes should be document with revision history and stored in a single repository.

**Upsides**

**Risks**

**Notes**

## Ask questions and alwayus ask for questions

## Include why when stating what
