_The "vision" of an organization can have a lot of different defintiions. Here we define it as optimistic look into the future where the organization has been extremely successful: what does that world look like? What has this organization created? This should be an inspiring and lasting statement that will speak to a variety of projects taken on within the organization.  This should complement and set context for the mission, design goals, and principles the organization follows._
