## Overview

üöß TODO

## Legal front matter

This is the basic legal framework to ensure contributors' work is dealt with fairly and appropriately.

### Intellectual property, copyright, and legal matters

‚öñÔ∏è TODO

## Supported coding environment

The supported workflow is to use GitHub Codespaces so that there is a normalized, easy to replicate development environment. The development environment is in a Ubuntu-based container as defined by the devcontainer [`Dockerfile`](../../../.devcontainer/Dockerfile). The devcontainer set up also ensures any common settings and plugins are unified across developers. Contributors are highly enouraged to use this approach to minimize setup discrepancies.

## Directory structure

The project uses a ["monorepo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) approach to development. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) is used as the storage mechanism for large and/or binary assets.

-   `deploy` - files related to publishing & deploying
-   `source`
    -   `projects` - main, continually developed projects
    -   `lib` - reusable libraries of code
    -   `sandbox` - prototypes, experiments, and one-off code

## Development process

### Build conventions

Every project should have a `Makefile` that defines the following commands that should "just work" when run in a valid development environment:

-   `ensure` - install dependencies and other "one-time" setup
-   `clean` - remove all generated files from the project
-   `build` - compile only
-   `dev` - run in manner optimized for rapid development
-   `run` - run with production settings
-   `test` - run unit tests and/or integration tests
-   `benchmark` - run performance tests
-   `publish` - deploy or otherwise make public the project

A `Makefile` is used to make projects runnable and testable uniformly across language. A developer should be able to run a project locally without needing to understand the particular toolchain of the project's underlying language.

Ideally the `Makefile` is a very thin wrapper on the underlying tooling. As a general principle be wary of complex build scripts or sequences as they often can become hard to understand and/or become fragile as the project evolves.

In practice, this means:

-   Preferring `Makefile` commands over a `scripts` entry in `package.json`. If the `scripts` section is used, the `Makefile` should provide wrappers on those scripts.

## Communication conventions

### Emoji conventions

Emojis are used as visual symbols in the project. As symbols, they can help convey a common idea quickly - if that symbol has a meaning that's defined and used consistently!

-   üí° Idea or thought
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
-   üö´ Avoid
-   üêâ Danger!
-   üöß TODO
-   üì£ Publication or release
-   üìö Documentation, tutorials, or guides
-   ‚ûï New or improved functionality
-   üß¨ Experiments and sandboxes
-   üõ†Ô∏è Defect fix
-   üóÉÔ∏è Internal organization, code improvements, or architecture
-   ‚öñÔ∏è Legal matter
-   ü¶ï Historical matter
-   üìê Design decision
-   üÄÑ Design pattern

### Badge conventions

**_üöß TODO: determine if these are used enough to require conventions_**

## Type of contributions

### Content

In this context, "content" is defined as adding another instance of something that already exists in the project. A content contribution might be a new item type in the game or a new character backstory in the worldbuilding. This contrasts from a "feature" where a feature might be a new _type of_ item or character. There will be a blurry line between a feature and content at times, but in general, content is a new variation of a common pattern whereas a feature has some introduces some novel aspect that is unique to the project.

### Refinements

Small modifications to existing content or functionality that better aligns it to project goals. This includes bug fixes and content corrections.

### Features

New functionality that does not have a parallel in the project.

### Gardening

Minor changes to ensure consistent structure across the project. Fixing typoes, style inconsistencies, etc. By definition, these should be uncontroversial changes - and often the type that ideally could be automated!
