In the other room, the chair dragged across the floor of the kitchen. Kestrel suspected Logan was making noise to let her know where he was. She was still feverish, he was still a stranger, and she was lying in his guest bed after a fog memories of how precisely she got there. Whether he was doing it to give her the comfort that he was there or to let her know he was not a threat was unclear.

Her fever was down significantly, but she was still not well. The memories was fragmented and confusing. She was beginning to doubt whether her mind had not suffered some permanent damage. This was a deeply frightening thought.

She had woken in a sleeping chamber a day and a half before arriving here. The problems began that it was a solo sleeping chamber: she had never seen nor even heard of such a thing. All the sleeping chambers she had ever known of were vast, warehouse-like structures buried beneath the city-state. The complex machinery to run them mandated that they be clustered densely together within the many layers of protection and insulation that the city-states could provide. A solitary sleeping chamber for a single person buried underground in the forest was unheard of.

She had woken up sick. She knew something was very wrong. It had been hard to focus and instinct more than rational thought had guided her. She changed into the clothes and grabbed the supplies that had been there for her waking. She vaguely remembered trying to look around and shouting for others, but even in her delirium, it had felt absurd for the capsule of the sleeping chamber itself filled the small room which was nearly bare otherwise beyond the narrow stairwell up to the surface. Had she searched the room and stairwell for hatches or doors that might lead elsewhere or was that just her imagination now retrofitting what had truly happened?

The stairwell lead to a doorway burrowed cleverly into the shallow cave, keeping it hidden from even a close observer but also too small to become the habitation of a larger creature. The cave lead out to the forest. A forest that Kestrel did not know.

Here the fever turned her memory into one of a simple fog of desparation. She stumbled forward into the forest and found, not far from the cave she had left, a path or small roadway through the forest. She followed it. She had decided following that road would lead her to another and thus her brain devoted all her resources to doing so. The rest was a blur. Day became night. She stumbled on through the night, her body sensing some ancestral signal that even resting might translate into death. The sun rose and onward she went. Half-memories and half-imaginings of the slow, stumbling progress she made as the next day faded towards night filled her head. She was not certain how much of it was real or imagined.

And then Logan saw her. A cabin in the woods and a man. Her situation was too desparate for her to feel fear, to have questions, to have doubts. Alone was death. She let the man lead her to the cabin. Presumably he lead or carried her to the bed in his spare room.

Windows of consciousness came and went. He brought her water. He asked questions and she tried to mumble answers. She did not know how much time passed while she was in this state. Then the fever began to fade. It was strange that the sharp pain of a terrible headache and aching in her body should feel so welcome: the pain, however awful, meant she was alive. Logan's questions about who she was and where she had come from where now coherent to her, but her answers were sparse. It was some time before she could piece together even that journey from the sleeping chamber to where she was then.

Her name was Kestrel. She was a woman from the city-state of Melanor. She could not remember what she had done there, but had memories of her childhood, of her mother and father. She might have been a scientist or researcher, for many half-formed thoughts filled her head about the structure and systems that underlay the workings of the city-state. But these thoughts were too vague.

She could not make a coherent story out of her past, despite Logan's questions and efforts to help. Yet, in his asking, inconsistencies arose that struck her with a terror, an emptiness. She spoke once of a visit by Tristan, the sole remaining artificial intelligence in Galthea, the so-called Guardian, to her city-state of Melanor. Logan listened careful not to disturb her efforts at recollection. But when Kestrel asked him of what he knew of Tristan, Logan told her that Tristan had disappeared from communication over forty years ago much to fear and consternation of all the peoples of Galthea.

Something was wrong.

They proceeded slowly and carefully in piecing together Kestrel's past from there. Logan did not want to dislodge Kestrel from a sense of stability in her recovery. Kestrel wanted the same for herself. Little progress was made and instead only more inconsistencies were found.

She now believed that she had been in hibertation in that unknown sleeping chamber for close to century, far longer than the devices were intended for. As for Melanor, it was a distant city-state, hundreds upon hundreds of miles north from the Sherwell forests wherein Logan's cabin was located. There was no hint in Kestrel's recollection of how she might have come to the North, she knew it to be called. Such a trip was unheard of with the grip of the maelstrom plaguing any journey of any length outside the city-states.

NOTE: every character needs a goal. They need to pursue that and run into obstacles. This is true of every character that runs into any other. Each thinks they are the protagonist.

Kestrel wakes in a underground, solo sleeping chamber. This is confusing, because all the sleeping chambers she has every heard of are under the city-states and massive. She knows something is wrong. She has a deep fever and is feeling disoriented - more than she should even after waking from the sleeping chamber.

NOTE: more explicit from the very first paragraph about what kind of story this is going to be, the conflict, the fundamental problem.

She wanders down the forest trail. Her fever rapidly gets worse. She comes across Logan's cabin. She collapses there. In her rambling, it is clear that she has been asleep for a long time. She speaks of Tristan, who has been missing for half a century.

Logan takes her to CITYNAME to meet Meagan, on the way to meet Graham.

Graham's father is the leader of the city-state of NAME. He is dealing with bordering city-states that are raiding and battling each other to acquire caches of Wayland Artifacts that have been found.

Graham wants to leave NAME to search out EQUIVALENT OF THE GRAIL.
