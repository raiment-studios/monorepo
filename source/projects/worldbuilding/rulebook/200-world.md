# The World of Raiment: Galthea

* A number of isolated city-states (cities and outlying lands with a distinct political character)
* Connected by Wayland Trails (roads lined with Wayland artifacts)
* Maelstrom active in the lands between, which are in flux
* Travel between the city-states is dangerous, even for the imbued


## The Imbued

A an "imbued" person is someone who has limited immunity to the effects of the Maelstrom. The most common case of becoming imbued is exposure to the maelstrom that the person in question survives.

The term is often used in a derogatory manner. Being imbued makes the person an outsider in a way that can lead to being ostracized. 

## Cultural ancestories

The world of Galthea is a human-world. The history of Galthea prior to the Great Malestrom is not well understood, but it is believed that civilization had reached a peaceful period where the basic needs of all individuals was met. The world was populated largely by humans of all varieties and large world-scale artificial intelligences. Animals existed, though it is unclear how many species of animals existed prior to the Great Maelstrom.

In Kestrel's time, city-states are populated by **factions** that share many political, religious, and cultural beliefs. These beliefs, more than physical characteristics, tend to define the group, thus city-states are often populated with a diverse variety of intrinsic physical attributes (height, eye color, skin color, etc.) and uniformity in the adopted cultural attributes (hair style, clothing style, figures of speech).  This does not mean the world of Galthea is a world without prejudice: it is only that the prejudice and scapegoating by the people of Galthea tends to be based on a person's cultural origin rather than physical characteristics.

## Artificial intelligences

The world-scale artificial intelligences of Galthea of the past are gone save for Tristan, a reduced fragment of that history of great AIs.  With Tristan missing, the AIs seem to be gone entirely.

Kestrel is a strange anomaly in this pattern: individual android-like artificial intelligences (know as a Aneides) is a idea of fiction in modern Galthea.  That Kestrel exists is difficult to explain.

It is said in some incarnations of Galthea, there may be other Aneides - but they lack of stability and skewed intelligences may hint at why Kestrel is so rare.
