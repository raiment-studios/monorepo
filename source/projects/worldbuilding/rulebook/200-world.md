# The World of Raiment: Galthea

* A number of isolated city-states (cities and outlying lands with a distinct political character)
* Connected by Wayland Trails (roads lined with Wayland artifacts)
* Maelstrom active in the lands between, which are in flux
* Travel between the city-states is dangerous, even for the imbued


## The Imbued

A an "imbued" person is someone who has limited immunity to the effects of the Maelstrom. The most common case of becoming imbued is exposure to the maelstrom that the person in question survives.

The term is often used in a derogatory manner. Being imbued makes the person an outsider in a way that can lead to being ostracized.
