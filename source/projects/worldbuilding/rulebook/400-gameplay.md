## Interactions

When a character is introduced to the game, they are assigned a number of Interactions. These are the specific ways the player can interact with that character.  The set of interactions may include generic interactions (applicable to all or broad categories of characters), context dependent interactions (a character may be assigned items, knowledge, or actions relative to active plots with in the world), and character-specific interactions.

Possible interactions lead to outcomes. Interactions rarely have a single fixed outcome and instead rely on some element of chance & circumstance.

Interactions are always player initiated.  They are described as imperative statements.

Common interactions 

* ASK property
    * NAME
* BUY / BARTER FOR item
* FIGHT


_ðŸ›ˆ Note: each playthrough of Raiment is not necessarily "winnable" in the sense that players can take actions that, be taking them, make it impossible for the player to find Tristan.  For example, players have the freedom to "fight" every character they meet and even if they "win" each fight, in doing so, either kill or earn the distrust of characters who have player needs the help of to find Tristan._


## Skill system

* Characters gain new skills but do not linearly "get stronger"
* Skills are characterized as expert, talented, average, challenging, or weaknesses
* Unknown skills are generally considered challening until they have been done several times and then become average
* Weaknesses are usually rare, but permanent
* Expert skills are rare and only gained through special circumstances
* Skilles do increase over time and are not fully balanced between strengths and weakness
