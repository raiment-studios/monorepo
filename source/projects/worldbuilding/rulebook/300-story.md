### Kestrel awakes

Kestrel wakes from a sleeping chamber. Alone, which is unusual since all the sleeping chambers she knows of are under the city-states and house thousands of people in a closely confined space when a Great Maelstrom has come across the world. She wakes with the usual confusion and low fever of the long sleep.

She leaves the underground sleeping chamber to find it is outside any of the city-states, which does not fit with any of her recollections.  Outside the protection of any Wayland artifacts and not knowing her location, she seeks out aid.  Her fever is getting worse.

After days of walking, she arrives delirious at the small cabin of a man named Logan. He houses her while the fever pulls into a deep sleep for several days.

When she wakes and recovers, Kestrel soon discovers several things: Tristan, the great artificial intelligence who watches over humanity and initiates the sleeping chambers during a Great Maelstrom, has not been seen for over a century.  The last three Great Maelstroms during that period were devasting to the human population as a result.

She later (TODO why) realizes she is an Aneides (the Galthean word for andriod. This revelation is profound: Tristan was the last artificial intelligence and aneiedi were a figment of the lost history of Galthea.

The disappearance of Tristan is her only connection to who she is -- and thus it becomes her purpose to seek out what happened to Tristan, who must be her creator.

### Logan

When Logan first meets Kestrel, he knows she is not simply a lost human stumbling to his cabin.

Logan himself is imbued, to a degree he has long kept secret. He is far older than he lets on and, as far as he knows, almost entirely immune to the maddening effects of the maelstrom.  He travels from city-state to city-state so his nature will not be noted, but while there, often takes on the high-risk jobs available everywhere where it is required for someone to risk venturing into the unsafe lands haunted by the maelstrom.  He has been ona quiet, private quest to understand what the maelstrom really is.

When he finds out what Kestrel is and that she, unlike any other advanced artificial intelligence other than Tristan, seems to be able to sustain the effects of the maelstrom - it is as if she too is imbued.  He attaches to her, knowing she may be a key to discovering what the origin of the maelstrom is.

He has heard that the city-state of Isilsea is ruled by King Graham and Queen Morgan, both imbued. In their small kingdom, there is a growing effort to seek out the cause of the maelstrom.  Though the journey is far and the way not clear due to the shifting uncertainties of the maelstrom, Logan thinks that traveling with Kestrel to Isilsea may be the way to explore what the maelstrom is.
