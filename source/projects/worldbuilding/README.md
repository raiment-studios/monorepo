## Roadmap

### March 2022: Thoughts on the roadmap

This is a solo hobby project and my time is more limited than I would like. While the vision of Raiment is grand, I am trying to trim down the roadmap to be able to ship a playable, enjoyable, _complete_ game even if it is small.

The world of Raiment emphasizes adventure, story-telling, and exploration. The world is procedural. The gameplay is deck-based. The game should be easy to contribute to.  The basic story is of Kestrel's search for her creator, Tristan, in the maelstrom-haunted world of Galthea.

**Milestone 1: Untitled (miminal, tile-based 2D world)**

A tile-based, 2D world where the deck is composed of a minimal number of cards and the story is largely hard-coded.  The objective is to make a complete, playable game however minimal.  The story will borrow from the general patterns of King's Quest I to give this a well-defined scope.

The game will have "screens" rather than an open world for simplicity.

**Milestone 2: Untitled (voxel screens)**

This milestone use a voxel world of 250x250 non-destructible voxel screens. It will continue to be turn-based.

**Milestone 3: Untitled (voxel open world)**

This milestone will convert the screen-based approach into an open world. The engine will switch from turn-based to real-time.
