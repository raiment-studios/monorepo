# Feature proposal

When leaving a city or safe zone, the player can equip a pre-defined pack. This a "loadout mechanic."

In the game, equipment (and characters) are not intended to linearly get more and more powerful, but rather (like a deck-building game) rely on combinations of equipment that allows for different capabilities, each configuration with its own strengths and weaknesses.

When leaving a city-state or other safe haven, the character chooses what items they will have...

As a game mechanic, perhaps the player should choose a pack-out with a fixed maximum size and enforced amount of free space for collecting new items. This of course doesn't make a lot of sense in reality, but may be a good game mechanic.
