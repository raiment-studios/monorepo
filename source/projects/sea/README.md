# sea

At the moment, Sea is a loosely formed idea that needs more definition...

A build tool that hides all the complexity of distributed systems tooling, from Terraform to eslint to WASM to Kubernetes to CRUD.

A programming language similar to Rust but with first-class support for a garbage-collected variant type.

A wiki for self-documenting code & ideas that allows incremental development from idea to working services.

Supports running locally, running remotely, running a combination of local & remote.  Supports hot-reloading and fast rebuilds.

Separation of data from interfaces for manipulating, accessing, and viewing that data.
