# Sea

At the moment, Sea is a loosely formed idea that needs more definition...

The overall goal is to produce a tool that makes working on Raiment simple, consistent, and easy.  It should focus on:

* Encouraging incremental, iterative development 
* Ensuring consistency of conventions
* Allowing content as well as code contributions & refinements

What this may mean...

A build tool that hides all the complexity of distributed systems tooling, from Terraform to eslint to WASM to Kubernetes to CRUD.  In practice, Sea may end up being a front-end to encapsulate the tooling and options on many of these other tools: thus trading some of their flexibility for simplicity by conforming the tools to specifics for the Raiment project.

A programming language similar to Rust but with first-class support for a garbage-collected variant type.

A wiki for self-documenting code & ideas that allows incremental development from idea to working services.

Supports running locally, running remotely, running a combination of local & remote.  Supports hot-reloading and fast rebuilds.

Separation of data from interfaces for manipulating, accessing, and viewing that data.
