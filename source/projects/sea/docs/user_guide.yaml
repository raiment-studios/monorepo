                An individual computer treated as a distributed system.

                The keyboard, monitor, and display are all centralized to a a single "main" computer.
                It is connected to other logical or physical devices allow modular expansion of the
                system. The system can dynamically upscale or downscale, so a laptop could become
                an extension of a main network when not being used independently.

                All processes are run as-if they were containers: fully independent and virtualized.
                They can be launched with some configuration and connect to other sources for 
                interaction with content and databases.

                The system runs services, which are named. It can use RPCs to communicate with them.

                An application runs itself and possible "workers" which are basically services local
                to the application itself.

                Storage is local with built in ability to mirror / sync to the cloud and use registries
                to popular local caches.

                The user filesystem is effectively a large git repository.  There can be multiple but
                the idea is is namespaced effectively to one.
