A wrapper on Jest to avoid needing to add configuration files to a project.

## Getting started

Step 1: install sea-jest

```bash
npm install --save @raiment/sea-jest
```

Step 2: Add sea-jest to your Makefile

```make
.PHONY: test
test:
    npx sea-jest --verbose .
```

## Vision

A JavaScript test framework that is so straightforward that it encourages adding unit tests to even the most trivial projects.

## Roadmap

### üèÅ v1.0 Checkpoints

-   [x] v0.1 Basic functionality
    -   [x] Invoke jest and pass all arguments
    -   [x] Encapsulate jest dependencies (so no user install is needed)
    -   [ ] Store snapshots next to test files
-   [ ] v0.2 Testing
    -   [ ] Add a `--help` flag that `sea-jest` catches
    -   [ ] Add a `--version` flag that `sea-jest` catches
    -   [ ] Add basic colors to match sea conventions

### üéÑ Backlog

-   [ ] Automate explicit addition of global names

## User documentation

`sea-jest` is a wrapper on Jest that applies the following configuration:

1. **ES6 by default**: `esbuild-jest` is used as a transform by default
2. **Snapshots stored side-by-side with test files**: this is an opinionated preference over the separate `__snapshots__` folder.

`sea-jest` is a wrapper that invokes `jest` internally so all flags are passed directly from `sea-jest` to `jest`.

## FAQ

#### Why not just use `jest` directly instead of `sea-jest`?

For many users, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) directly is the right choice!

`sea-jest` was created as minimal wrapper to avoid the duplicate boilerplate common to all Raiment Studios projects. If you like the "sea" conventions in general, then using sea-jest is presumably convenience, otherwise it's likely not for a value add for you!
