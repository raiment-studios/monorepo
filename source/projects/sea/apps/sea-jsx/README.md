A quick, simple command-line tool to run single JavaScript React Components with hot-reloading without tedious project configuration.

## Getting started

**Step 1**: install sea-jsx

```bash
npm install --global @raiment/sea-jsx
```

**Step 2**: Create a simple JSX file (`hello-world.js`)

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default function () {
    return <h1>Hello World!!</h1>;
}
```

**Step 3**: Run sea-jsx and see the output. Imports are automatically installed. Any updates to `hello-world.js` will hot-reload.

```bash
sea-jsx hello-world.js
```

## Vision

A quick, simple command-line tool to run single JavaScript React Components with hot-reloading without tedious project configuration. This allows quick experimentation and iteration without spending time on initial boilerplate and without cluttering workspaces with configuration and intermediate files. Work on the program, not the build configuration.

## User documentation

### Command-line usage

```
≅≅≅  sea-jsx v0.3.0  ≅≅≅

Commands:
  sea-jsx dev <filename>      run the script with automatic reloading
  sea-jsx build <filename>    compile the file to a bundle
  sea-jsx publish <filename>  build and deploy the target file
  sea-jsx clean               remove any temporary cached files

Options:
      --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]
  -v, --verbosity  Run with verbose logging                [number] [default: 0]
      --help       Show help                                           [boolean]
```

### Front matter

While `sea-jsx` is designed to minimize configuration, when it is required (such as to specify a particular package version), a comment-based front matter syntax **can optionally be used** to provide YAML configuration:

**Example**

```javascript
/*!@sea:header

    modules:
        lodash: 4
    publish:
        type: '@raiment/github-pages'
        org: raiment-studios
        path: hello/world.html
*/

import _ from 'lodash';

export default function() {
    return (<div>{_.snakeCase(Hello World)}</div>);
}
```

In this particular case, the package version for `lodash` is pinned to `4` and a deployment target on GitHub Pages is specified so the resulting build can easily be shared publicly.

### Configuration options

-   `modules` - a set of key-value pairs specifying the npm version to use when importing that particular package. Imports not listed in the module configuration will attempt to use the latest available version.

-   `publish` - a configuration describing how to publish the built code. This is intended to support simple destinations for quick public sharing of code.
    -   `type` - currently only `@raiment/github-pages` is supported as a publish type. This will upload the built file to a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) respository. This is a minimal effort static HTML hosting target.
    -   `[@raiment/github-pages]` `org` - the name of the GitHub org to publish to
    -   `[@raiment/github-pages]` `path` - the path within the respository to upload the file to. Existing files are that path will be overwritten without confirmation.

## Design

### Primary use case

**Rapid prototyping and experimentation of JSX Components in isolation**

### Design goals

1. Minimal setup and configuration
2. Standard JSX that will be transferable into production code
3. Sharing via rapid, minimal configuration deployment

These design goals follow from the primary use case.

### Sea conventions

`sea-jsx` is part of the `sea` suite (pun intended) of tools and attempts to follow the general workflow principles of the `sea` tooling:

-   [x] File-based and git-ops compatible
-   [x] Minimize use of custom or non-standard data formats or languages

### Architectural overview

The process can be thought of in two parts: (1) creating a "host environment" out of the browser with a known HTML base configuration, (2) executing the given program in that environment.

A future direction is to create a target types of Markdown and extended Markdown that can also be quickly displayed.

### Out of scope

-   **Automatic routing** - sea-jsx is not intended to be a site generator. Routing should be handled via external packages.
-   **Unit testing** - sea-jsx is primarily for rapid prototyping, not production code so has no built-in mechanisms to facilitate unit testing

## FAQ

### Product

#### What are some of the reasons to use `sea-jsx`?

It's easy to run `sea-jsx` and iterate on small, quick React prototypes.

`sea-jsx` is simple, fast, and doesn't lock you into any non-standard structures or configurations. If the prototype works, the JSX code is fully "standard" so it's easy to move or incorporate the code into tooling designed for larger projects. It's a great way to get started on fledgling ideas.

#### How does `sea-jsx` compare to, say, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)?

`sea-jsx` is not designed for building websites.

It does not intend to be a full-fledged site generator. It is intended instead to be quick, easy way to run on individual JSX files (or a small set of them) with minimal configuration. The primary use case is prototyping and rapid experimentation.

#### How do I change the header, page title, add CSS, etc.?

The recommended way is to do so through libraries or the [standard Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document).

Here's trivial example of code that could be used put in an outer component to set the page title:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
    document.title = 'My personal homepage (under construction!)';
});
```

#### Does sea-jsx prioritize convenience over robustness and security?

Yes. `sea-jsx` is designed to be development tool which is presumed to be used in a secure development environment. Production deployment is outside the intended scope of `sea-jsx`'s design
