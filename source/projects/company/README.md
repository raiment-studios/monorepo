## Principles

The company **Principles** are the general guidelines for how work is done as part of the company. 

1. [Show-don't-tell](#show-dont-tell)
1. [Consistent, structured processes](#consistent-structured-processes)


### Show-don't-tell

Rapid prototying, mocks, and demonstration branches are preferred over long documents.  This principle is intended to balance [Consistent, Structured Processes](#consistent-structured-processes) so that process does not _reduce_ efficiency.


### Consistent, structured processes

Any _non-trivial_ work should follow the same standard set of steps from introducing the proposal, implementing it, reviewing it, testing it, and releasing it. The purpose of this structure is that consistency allows more efficient, objective work to be done as less time is lost to confusion due to an ill-defined process. This is particularly important for distributed, community-driven, creative work.

Consistent processes should be thought of as "work patterns" (in the "design patterns" sense). 

**Manifestations**

* Templates & prototypes (in the "copy from an existing example" sense)
* Self review checkiists
* Peer review checklists

**Upsides**

* Low-overhead, efficienct communication

**Risks**

* More rocess overhead than "actual work"
* Constraints on flexibility or innovation
* Process before purpose
