_The "mission" of an organziation can have a lot of different definitions. Here we define it as a long-lasting statement of what work we do when we contribute to the project.  This complements the [Vision](./vision.md), which is which is a statement of what the world looks like a some distant point in the future if we continue to pursue this mission._
