## Features

New functionality that does not have a parallel in the project.

## Content

In this context, "content" is defined as adding another instance of something that already exists in the project.  A content contribution might be a new item type in the game or a new character backstory in the worldbuilding.  This contrasts from a "feature" where a feature might be a new _type of_ item or character. There will be a blurry line between a feature and content at times, but in general, content is a new variation of a common pattern whereas a feature has some introduces some novel aspect that is unique to the project.

## Refinements

Small modifications to existing content or functionality that better aligns it to project goals.

## Gardening

Minor changes to ensure consistent structure across the project.  Fixing typoes, style inconsistencies, etc.  By definition, these should be uncontroversial changes - and often the type that ideally could be automated!
