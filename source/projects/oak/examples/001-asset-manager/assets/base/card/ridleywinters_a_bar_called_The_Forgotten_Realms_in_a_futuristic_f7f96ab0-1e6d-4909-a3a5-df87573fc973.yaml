    title: A Future Break

            Nothing like a like rest and relaxation in the future 
            before hurrying back to the past.

        Invokes a maelstrom event that pushes the party through time
        into a future place that is safe and allows them to recuperate.
        The future location is isolated and detached from the thread
        of the story. If the characters push too hard, it will rip
        apart and return them to their original time.
