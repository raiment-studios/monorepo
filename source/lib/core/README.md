A generic JavaScript utility library designed for use in [Raiment Studios](https://github.com/raiment-studios/monorepo) projects.

## Getting started

## Vision

`@raiment/core` is a generic utility library designed for use in Raiment Studios projects.  It is meant to encapsulate solutions to common problems into a centralized library biased towards small, highly interative projects.

As such, it leverages a number of other low-level libraries internally to handle the implementations. The goal is not reduce the cognitive load for the new developer by consolidating utilities into one place instead of potentially having to recognize dozens of new libraries and their purposes.
