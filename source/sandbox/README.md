# Sandbox

This directory is for experiments.


## Review checklist 

Each sandbox project...

* [ ] Should be categorized under a folder by the "primary" technology
* [ ] Should have a `README` defining its purpose
* [ ] Should have a `make dev` command at minimum
* [ ] Should be in a working state before merging into `main`
