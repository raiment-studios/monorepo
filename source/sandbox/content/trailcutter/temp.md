Cultus Lake and Crane Prairie Campground

11 mile trail run around Cultus Lake. Then spent the night at the campground.

Reflections:

-   Don't forget a plate and bread knife
-   A mini-sink for washing hands would have been more water efficient
-   Keep a camp
-   I like driving a small car
-   Desire to clean myself off after a 11 mile trail run before sleep
-   Tent easy to set up, hard to put away in a clean, organized fashion
-   Be wary of a mid-day run even if you have plenty of water
-   Generators in an otherwise peaceful setting are not awesome
