## What is the Raiment?

**Raiment is a procedural, open world game: think Daggerfall set in a voxel-based world. It is designed specifically to be equally enjoyable to play as it is to contribute to.**

## Status

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not%20yet%20ready!-d53)](https://raiment-studios.zulipchat.com/)

The Raiment game itself is in **early development and there is no public, playable version yet available!** This respository contains the tools and content being built that eventually will support the game.

The projects within Raiment include worldbuilding content (art, stories, assets, etc.), a rulebook, a voxel-based game engine, and a set of tools designed to make contributions easy. Please take a look at our [Vision statement](source/projects/organization/vision.md) to see if this is a project you'd like to contribute to!

## Design

-   **Ease and enjoyable to contribute to**: a friendly community and straightforward process to make small contributions possible for anyone
-   **Visually appealing and also accessible on low-end devices**

_The Raiment uses a deck-based approach to procedurally create the world. Users define the deck they want to use for a play-through and those cards effectively become the "mods" that define that playythrough._

## Projects

Project work is categorized into the following:

-   [**Organization**](source/projects/organization) - guidelines on how we work aimed to make contributions easier

-   **Marketing** - the public website and material designed to encourage participation

## Technology

The project is currently coded primarily in `JavaScript` in order to rapidly flesh out the first prototypes of the project and ensure they are easily accesible on the web. After the initial prototyping stabilizes, the project intends to migrate towards a `Rust` and `JavaScript` mix, utilizing `WASM` when appropriate.
