## What is the "Raiment"?

Raiment Studios is creating an open source world designed to be enjoyable and easy to contribute to. The projects include worldbuilding content (art, stories, assets, etc.), a rulebook, a voxel-based game engine, and a set of tools designed to make contributions easy. Please take a look at our [Vision statement](source/projects/organization/vision.md) to see if this is a project you'd like to contribute to!

After the initial prototyping stabilizes, the project intends to migrate towards a Rust and JavaScript mix, utilizing WASM when appropriate.
